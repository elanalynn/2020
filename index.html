    <h1>Hello.</h1>
    <p>
      I make software. I have experience with JavaScript (TypeScript, AngularJS, Angular, React, and Node), Python and
      RAILS. I also have a background in design, UX, and marketing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from development and design, I like learning, teaching, and community building. While I was an Instructor, I
      launched a women in tech meetup on two campuses, a mentorship program, and a lunch n’ learn program. In my current
      role at Guild Education, I have managed a Diversity & Inclusion committee. I’ve presented a few talks at meetups
      and I’m always open to volunteer opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I enjoy drawing, writing, reading, hiking, skiing, and yoga. I am passionate about giving animals
      a voice, protecting them from harm, and shifting our perspectives towards them. I also care deeply about
      developing equitable education for everyone.
    </p>
